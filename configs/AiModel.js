  It needs to include all topic points listed for each chapter.
  Basic inline styling should be used for presentation, maintaining a consistent structure across chapters.
  
  Plan:
  1.  Iterate through each chapter in the provided JSON data.
  2.  For each chapter:
      *   Create a main container \`div\` for the chapter content.
      *   Add a heading (\`h2\`) with the chapter number, emoji, and title. Apply some styling (e.g., \`margin-bottom\`, \`color\`).
      *   Add a paragraph (\`p\`) for the chapter summary. Apply some styling (e.g., \`font-style: italic\`).
      *   Add a heading (\`h3\`) for the "Key Topics / Exam Content". Apply styling.
      *   Create an unordered list (\`ul\`) to list the detailed content for each topic. Apply styling (e.g., \`list-style-type: square\`).
      *   Iterate through the \`topics\` array for the current chapter.
      *   For each topic:
          *   Create a list item (\`li\`).
          *   Inside the \`li\`, add a \`strong\` tag for the topic title (e.g., "What is Python?").
          *   Add a colon and a brief explanation or key points related to that topic, tailored for exam preparation. This is the core content generation part. I need to elaborate on each topic point mentioned in the input JSON.
      *   Combine all generated HTML elements for the chapter.
  3.  Concatenate the HTML strings for all chapters.
  4.  Ensure consistent inline styles are applied (e.g., font sizes, margins, colors).
  
  Detailed Content Generation for each topic:
  
  *   **Chapter 1: Getting Started with Python**
      *   **What is Python?**: High-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Known for readability and simple syntax.
      *   **Why learn Python?**: Versatile (web dev, data science, AI, scripting), large community, beginner-friendly, lots of libraries.
      *   **Using the Python Interpreter (REPL/Shell)**: Interactive mode (type code, get immediate results), useful for testing snippets. Accessed by typing \`python\` or \`python3\` in the terminal.
      *   **Running Python scripts (.py files)**: Writing code in a file (e.g., \`my_script.py\`), executing from the terminal using \`python my_script.py\`.
      *   **Your first program: \`print('Hello, World!')\`**: The \`print()\` function is used to display output to the console. \`'Hello, World!'\` is a string literal.
      *   **Understanding code comments (\`#\`)**: Lines starting with \`#\` are ignored by the interpreter. Used for explaining code or temporarily disabling lines.
  
  *   **Chapter 2: Variables and Basic Data Types**
      *   **What are variables?**: Named containers for storing data values.
      *   **Assigning values to variables (\`=\`)**: Use the assignment operator (\`=\`) to store a value in a variable (e.g., \`age = 30\`).
      *   **Variable naming rules and conventions (snake_case)**: Must start with a letter or underscore, can contain letters, numbers, underscores. Case-sensitive. Convention: use \`snake_case\` (e.g., \`first_name\`).
      *   **Integers (\`int\`)**: Whole numbers (e.g., \`10\`, \`-5\`, \`0\`).
      *   **Floating-point numbers (\`float\`)**: Numbers with a decimal point (e.g., \`3.14\`, \`-0.5\`).
      *   **Strings (\`str\`) - creating with single or double quotes**: Sequences of characters used for text. Created using \`'...'\` or \`"..."\` (e.g., \`'hello'\`, \`"Python"\`).
      *   **Basic string operations (concatenation with \`+\`)**: Combining strings using the \`+\` operator (e.g., \`'Py' + 'thon'\` results in \`'Python'\`).
      *   **Booleans (\`bool\`) - \`True\` and \`False\`**: Represent truth values. Note the capitalization. Result of comparisons.
      *   **Checking data types (\`type()\` function)**: Use \`type(variable_name)\` to find out the data type of a variable (e.g., \`type(10)\` returns \`<class 'int'>\`).
      *   **Basic type conversion (\`int()\`, \`float()\`, \`str()\`)**: Functions to convert between types (e.g., \`int('123')\`, \`str(42)\`, \`float('3.14')\`). Be aware of potential errors (e.g., \`int('hello')\`).
  
  *   **Chapter 3: Basic Operators**
      *   **Arithmetic Operators: \`+\`, \`-\`, \`*\`, \`/\`, \`%\` (Modulo)**: \`+\` (addition), \`-\` (subtraction), \`*\` (multiplication), \`/\` (true division - always results in float), \`%\` (modulo - remainder of division).
      *   **Comparison Operators: \`==\` (Equal to), \`!=\` (Not equal to), \`>\`, \`<\`, \`>=\`, \`<=\`**: Compare two values, result in a Boolean (\`True\` or \`False\`). \`==\` checks for equality, \`!=\` checks for inequality.
      *   **Assignment Operators: Simple assignment \`=\`**: Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
      *   **Logical Operators: \`and\`, \`or\`, \`not\`**: Combine Boolean values. \`and\` (True if both are True), \`or\` (True if at least one is True), \`not\` (inverts the truth value).
  
  *   **Chapter 4: Making Decisions (Conditional Statements)**
      *   **The \`if\` statement**: Executes a block of code *only if* a condition is \`True\`. Syntax: \`if condition:\`.
      *   **The \`else\` statement**: Executes a block of code if the preceding \`if\` (or \`elif\`) condition(s) were \`False\`. Syntax: \`else:\`. Follows an \`if\` or \`elif\`.
      *   **The \`elif\` statement (else if)**: Checks another condition *only if* the preceding \`if\` or \`elif\` conditions were \`False\`. Allows for multiple checks. Syntax: \`elif condition:\`. Can have multiple \`elif\`s.
      *   **Combining conditions with logical operators**: Use \`and\`, \`or\`, \`not\` within the \`if\`/\`elif\` condition (e.g., \`if age > 18 and has_license:\`).
      *   **The importance of indentation**: Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define code blocks belonging to \`if\`, \`elif\`, \`else\`, loops, functions, etc. Consistent indentation is mandatory.
  
  *   **Chapter 5: Repeating Actions (Loops)**
      *   **The \`while\` loop**: Repeats a block of code *as long as* a condition remains \`True\`. Syntax: \`while condition:\`. Need to ensure the condition eventually becomes \`False\` to avoid infinite loops.
      *   **The \`for\` loop**: Iterates over a sequence (like a string, list, or range) or other iterable object. Executes the block once for each item in the sequence. Syntax: \`for variable in sequence:\`.
      *   **Using the \`range()\` function with \`for\` loops**: \`range()\` generates a sequence of numbers. \`range(5)\` -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. \`range(1, 6)\` -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. \`range(0, 10, 2)\` -> 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. Commonly used for repeating a block a specific number of times.
      *   **Iterating over characters in a string**: A \`for\` loop can directly iterate over the characters of a string (e.g., \`for char in 'hello': print(char)\`).
      *   **Basic loop control: \`break\` (exit loop early - brief mention)**: The \`break\` statement immediately terminates the current loop (\`for\` or \`while\`).
  
  *   **Chapter 6: Working with Lists**
      *   **What is a list?**: An ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items. Items can be of different data types.
      *   **Creating lists \`[]\`**: Use square brackets \`[]\`, separating items with commas (e.g., \`my_list = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]\`). An empty list is \`[]\`.
      *   **Accessing list items using index (starting from 0)**: Use square brackets with the index number (position). The first item is at index 0, second at 1, etc. (e.g., \`my_list[0]\`). Negative indices count from the end (\`my_list[-1]\` is the last item).
      *   **Getting the length of a list: \`len()\`**: The \`len()\` function returns the number of items in the list (e.g., \`len(my_list)\`).
      *   **Adding items to the end of a list: \`append()\`**: Use the \`append()\` method to add a single item to the end of the list (e.g., \`my_list.append('new')\`). Modifies the list in-place.
      *   **Checking if an item exists in a list (\`in\` keyword)**: Use the \`in\` operator to check for membership, returns \`True\` or \`False\` (e.g., \`'hello' in my_list\`).
  
  *   **Chapter 7: Creating Reusable Code (Functions)**
      *   **Why use functions?**: Organize code, avoid repetition (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself), make code reusable, improve readability and maintainability.
      *   **Defining a function using \`def\`**: Use the \`def\` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses \`()\`, and a colon \`:\`. The indented block below is the function body. Syntax: \`def function_name():\`.
      *   **Calling a function**: Execute the code inside a function by using its name followed by parentheses \`()\` (e.g., \`function_name()\`).
      *   **Function parameters (inputs)**: Variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They act as placeholders for inputs (e.g., \`def greet(name):\`).
      *   **Function arguments (values passed in)**: The actual values supplied to the function when it is called (e.g., \`greet('Alice')\`). The argument \`'Alice'\` is assigned to the parameter \`name\`.
      *   **The \`return\` statement (getting output from a function)**: Use \`return\` to send a value back from the function to where it was called. If omitted, the function implicitly returns \`None\`. (e.g., \`def add(a, b): return a + b\`).
      *   **Simple functions with and without parameters/return values**: Understand how to define and call functions that take no input and return nothing, take input but return nothing, take no input but return something, and take input and return something.
  
  *   **Chapter 8: Basic Input and Output**
      *   **Getting user input using \`input()\`**: The \`input()\` function pauses the program and waits for the user to type something and press Enter. It optionally takes a string argument as a prompt (e.g., \`name = input('Enter your name: ')\`).
      *   **Understanding that \`input()\` returns a string**: Crucially, \`input()\` *always* returns the user's input as a string (\`str\`), even if they type numbers.
      *   **Converting input using \`int()\` or \`float()\` for calculations**: If numerical input is needed for calculations, you must explicitly convert the string returned by \`input()\` using \`int()\` or \`float()\` (e.g., \`age_str = input('Age: '); age_num = int(age_str)\`). Handle potential \`ValueError\` if conversion fails (though error handling might be beyond basics).
      *   **Printing variables and text together**: Use the \`print()\` function with multiple arguments separated by commas (adds spaces automatically), or use string concatenation (\`+\`, requires explicit \`str()\` conversion for non-strings), or use f-strings.
      *   **Basic formatted output using f-strings (e.g., \`f'Hello, {name}!'\`)**: A convenient way to embed expressions (like variable values) inside string literals. Start the string with \`f\` or \`F\` before the quotes. Place variables or expressions inside curly braces \`{}\` (e.g., \`age = 30; print(f'You are {age} years old.')\`).
  
  Styling Considerations:
  *   Use consistent margins (\`margin-bottom: 15px;\` for headings, \`margin-bottom: 10px;\` for paragraphs/lists).
  *   Use a subtle color for headings (e.g., \`color: #333;\`).
  *   Use \`font-style: italic;\` for summaries.
  *   Use \`list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px;\` for the topic lists.
  *   Use \`font-weight: bold;\` for the topic titles within list items.
  *   Keep inline styles simple and focused on structure and readability.
  
  Constraint Checklist & Confidence Score:
  1.  Generate exam material detail content for each chapter: Yes
  2.  Include all topic points: Yes
  3.  Give content in HTML: Yes
  4.  Do not add HTML, Head, Body, title tag: Yes
  5.  Add some basic inline styles: Yes
  6.  Keep the structure consistent: Yes
  
  Confidence Score: 5/5
  
  Mental Sandbox:
  *   Consider the level of detail for each topic explanation. Since it's "EASY" difficulty, focus on definitions, syntax, and basic usage examples. Avoid complex edge cases.
  *   Ensure the HTML structure is valid and doesn't nest improperly. \`ul\` should contain \`li\`, \`li\` can contain \`strong\` and text.
  *   Check if the inline styles are correctly applied and consistent. For example, all \`h2\` should have similar styles, all \`ul\` should have similar styles.
  *   Review the generated content for clarity and accuracy based on the topic points. For example, for \`input()\`, emphasizing it returns a string is crucial for beginners. For operators, listing them clearly is important. For indentation, highlighting its mandatory nature is key. For f-strings, showing a simple example \`f'...'\` is sufficient.
  
  Refinement: Add a short introductory sentence for each topic explanation within the \`li\` tag to make it flow better. For example, instead of just "High-level...", start with "Python is a high-level...".`,

    <h2 style="color: #0056b3; margin-bottom: 10px;">🚀 Chapter 1: Getting Started with Python</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-bottom: 15px;">Learn what Python is, how to install it (if needed, often pre-installed or available online), and how to run your very first Python program using the print function.</p>
    <h3 style="color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;">Key Topics / Exam Content:</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px; color: #444;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">What is Python?</strong>: Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Key characteristics include being dynamically typed and garbage-collected.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Why learn Python?</strong>: It's versatile (used in web development, data science, AI, automation, etc.), has a large and supportive community, extensive libraries/frameworks, and is known for being relatively easy for beginners to learn compared to other languages.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Using the Python Interpreter (REPL/Shell)</strong>: The Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) allows you to type Python code directly and see immediate results. It's useful for testing small code snippets and exploring language features. Access it by typing \`python\` or \`python3\` in your terminal/command prompt. The \`>>>\` prompt indicates it's ready for input.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Running Python scripts (.py files)</strong>: For larger programs, code is saved in files with a \`.py\` extension (e.g., \`my_program.py\`). These scripts are executed from the terminal using the command \`python my_program.py\` or \`python3 my_program.py\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Your first program: \`print('Hello, World!')\`</strong>: The built-in \`print()\` function displays output to the console. Anything inside the parentheses (the argument) will be printed. \`'Hello, World!'\` is a string literal (text). This is the traditional first program to verify setup.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Understanding code comments (\`#\`)</strong>: Comments are explanatory notes within the code ignored by the Python interpreter. They start with the hash symbol (\`#\`) and continue to the end of the line. Used to explain what the code does or temporarily disable code lines.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: #0056b3; margin-bottom: 10px;">📦 Chapter 2: Variables and Basic Data Types</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-bottom: 15px;">Understand how to store information in variables and learn about the fundamental data types: numbers (integers and floats), text (strings), and boolean values (True/False).</p>
    <h3 style="color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;">Key Topics / Exam Content:</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px; color: #444;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">What are variables?</strong>: Variables are names given to memory locations used to store data values. Think of them as labels for data.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Assigning values to variables (\`=\`)</strong>: The assignment operator \`=\` is used to assign a value to a variable. Example: \`my_variable = 10\`. The value on the right is stored in the variable named on the left.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Variable naming rules and conventions (snake_case)</strong>: Rules: Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (\`_\`), can contain letters, numbers (0-9), and underscores. Case-sensitive (\`age\` is different from \`Age\`). Conventions: Use \`snake_case\` (all lowercase words separated by underscores, e.g., \`user_name\`). Avoid using Python keywords (like \`print\`, \`if\`, \`for\`).
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Integers (\`int\`)</strong>: Represent whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals. Examples: \`0\`, \`100\`, \`-5\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Floating-point numbers (\`float\`)</strong>: Represent numbers with a decimal point or in exponential notation. Examples: \`3.14\`, \`-0.01\`, \`2.5e2\` (which is 250.0).
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Strings (\`str\`) - creating with single or double quotes</strong>: Represent sequences of characters (text). Created by enclosing characters in either single quotes (\`'...'\`) or double quotes (\`"..."\`). Both are equivalent. Examples: \`'Hello'\`, \`"Python is fun"\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Basic string operations (concatenation with \`+\`)</strong>: The \`+\` operator can be used to join (concatenate) strings together. Example: \`greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World"\` results in \`"Hello World"\`. Note: You cannot directly concatenate strings and numbers without conversion.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Booleans (\`bool\`) - \`True\` and \`False\`</strong>: Represent logical truth values. There are only two boolean values: \`True\` and \`False\` (note the capitalization). They are often the result of comparison operations.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Checking data types (\`type()\` function)</strong>: The built-in \`type()\` function returns the data type of a variable or value. Example: \`type(10)\` returns \`<class 'int'>\`, \`type("hello")\` returns \`<class 'str'>\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Basic type conversion (\`int()\`, \`float()\`, \`str()\`)</strong>: Functions to convert values from one type to another. \`int()\` converts to integer (e.g., \`int('123')\`, \`int(3.9)\` results in \`3\`). \`float()\` converts to float (e.g., \`float('3.14')\`, \`float(10)\` results in \`10.0\`). \`str()\` converts to string (e.g., \`str(100)\`, \`str(True)\` results in \`'True'\`). Conversion might fail if the value is incompatible (e.g., \`int('hello')\` causes an error).
      </li>

    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-bottom: 15px;">Learn how to perform calculations (arithmetic), comparisons between values, and basic logical operations using Python's built-in operators.</p>
    <h3 style="color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;">Key Topics / Exam Content:</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px; color: #444;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Arithmetic Operators: \`+\`, \`-\`, \`*\`, \`/\`, \`%\` (Modulo)</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>\`+\` (Addition): Adds two numbers (e.g., \`5 + 3\` is \`8\`). Also concatenates strings.</li>
          <li>\`-\` (Subtraction): Subtracts the second number from the first (e.g., \`5 - 3\` is \`2\`).</li>
          <li>\`*\` (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers (e.g., \`5 * 3\` is \`15\`). Also repeats strings (e.g., \`'a' * 3\` is \`'aaa'\`).</li>
          <li>\`/\` (Division): Divides the first number by the second, always results in a float (e.g., \`10 / 2\` is \`5.0\`, \`5 / 2\` is \`2.5\`).</li>
          <li>\`%\` (Modulo): Returns the remainder of a division (e.g., \`5 % 3\` is \`2\`, \`10 % 2\` is \`0\`).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Comparison Operators: \`==\` (Equal to), \`!=\` (Not equal to), \`>\`, \`<\`, \`>=\`, \`<=\`</strong>: These operators compare two values and return a Boolean (\`True\` or \`False\`).
        <ul>
          <li>\`==\` (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal (e.g., \`5 == 5\` is \`True\`, \`5 == 3\` is \`False\`).</li>
          <li>\`!=\` (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal (e.g., \`5 != 3\` is \`True\`, \`5 != 5\` is \`False\`).</li>
          <li>\`>\` (Greater than): Checks if the left value is greater than the right (e.g., \`5 > 3\` is \`True\`).</li>
          <li>\`<\` (Less than): Checks if the left value is less than the right (e.g., \`3 < 5\` is \`True\`).</li>
          <li>\`>=\` (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right (e.g., \`5 >= 5\` is \`True\`).</li>
          <li>\`<=\` (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right (e.g., \`3 <= 5\` is \`True\`).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Assignment Operators: Simple assignment \`=\`</strong>: The primary assignment operator \`=\` assigns the value from the right side to the variable on the left side (e.g., \`x = 5\`). (Note: Compound assignment operators like \`+=\`, \`-=\` exist but might be beyond basics).
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Logical Operators: \`and\`, \`or\`, \`not\`</strong>: Combine or negate Boolean values.
        <ul>
          <li>\`and\`: Returns \`True\` if both operands are \`True\` (e.g., \`True and True\` is \`True\`, \`True and False\` is \`False\`).</li>
          <li>\`or\`: Returns \`True\` if at least one operand is \`True\` (e.g., \`True or False\` is \`True\`, \`False or False\` is \`False\`).</li>
          <li>\`not\`: Inverts the Boolean value; returns \`True\` if the operand is \`False\`, and \`False\` if the operand is \`True\` (e.g., \`not True\` is \`False\`).</li>
        </ul>

    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-bottom: 15px;">Control the flow of your program by executing different code blocks based on whether certain conditions are true or false, using if, elif, and else statements.</p>
    <h3 style="color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;">Key Topics / Exam Content:</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px; color: #444;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">The \`if\` statement</strong>: Executes a block of indented code only if the specified condition evaluates to \`True\`. Syntax: \`if condition: \\n    # code to execute if condition is True\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">The \`else\` statement</strong>: Provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition in the preceding \`if\` (or all preceding \`elif\`s) evaluates to \`False\`. It doesn't have its own condition. Syntax: \`else: \\n    # code to execute if condition(s) above were False\`. Must follow an \`if\` or \`elif\` block.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">The \`elif\` statement (else if)</strong>: Allows checking multiple conditions sequentially. If the initial \`if\` condition is \`False\`, the \`elif\` condition is checked. If it's \`True\`, its code block executes. If \`False\`, Python proceeds to the next \`elif\` or \`else\`. You can have multiple \`elif\` statements. Syntax: \`elif another_condition: \\n    # code to execute if this condition is True\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Combining conditions with logical operators</strong>: Logical operators (\`and\`, \`or\`, \`not\`) are used within the \`if\` or \`elif\` conditions to create more complex checks. Example: \`if age >= 18 and has_ticket: \\n    print("Allowed entry")\`. Example: \`if temperature < 0 or temperature > 100: \\n    print("Warning: Extreme temperature!")\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">The importance of indentation</strong>: Python uses indentation (whitespace, typically 4 spaces) to define code blocks. The code that belongs to an \`if\`, \`elif\`, or \`else\` statement *must* be indented consistently. Incorrect indentation will cause errors (\`IndentationError\`) or logical bugs. This is a fundamental aspect of Python syntax.

    <h2 style="color: #0056b3; margin-bottom: 10px;">🔁 Chapter 5: Repeating Actions (Loops)</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-bottom: 15px;">Learn how to repeat blocks of code efficiently using \`for\` loops (for iterating over sequences like strings or ranges) and \`while\` loops (for repeating as long as a condition is true).</p>
    <h3 style="color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;">Key Topics / Exam Content:</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px; color: #444;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">The \`while\` loop</strong>: Repeats a block of indented code as long as a specified condition evaluates to \`True\`. Syntax: \`while condition: \\n    # code to repeat\`. The condition is checked *before* each iteration. It's essential to ensure the condition eventually becomes \`False\` within the loop's body to avoid an infinite loop (unless intended).
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">The \`for\` loop</strong>: Iterates over the items of any sequence (like a list or a string) or other iterable object, executing the indented code block once for each item. Syntax: \`for item_variable in sequence: \\n    # code using item_variable\`. In each iteration, \`item_variable\` takes the value of the next item in the \`sequence\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Using the \`range()\` function with \`for\` loops</strong>: The \`range()\` function generates a sequence of numbers, commonly used to make a \`for\` loop execute a specific number of times.
        <ul>
           <li>\`range(stop)\`: Generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) \`stop\`. Example: \`range(3)\` produces \`0, 1, 2\`.</li>
           <li>\`range(start, stop)\`: Generates numbers from \`start\` up to (but not including) \`stop\`. Example: \`range(1, 4)\` produces \`1, 2, 3\`.</li>
           <li>\`range(start, stop, step)\`: Generates numbers from \`start\` up to \`stop\`, incrementing by \`step\`. Example: \`range(0, 6, 2)\` produces \`0, 2, 4\`.</li>
        </ul>
        Example usage: \`for i in range(5): print(i)\` will print 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Iterating over characters in a string</strong>: A \`for\` loop can directly iterate through each character in a string. Example: \`for char in "Hi!": print(char)\` will print 'H', then 'i', then '!'.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Basic loop control: \`break\` (exit loop early - brief mention)</strong>: The \`break\` statement immediately terminates the innermost \`for\` or \`while\` loop it is contained within. Execution continues with the first statement *after* the loop block. Used to exit a loop prematurely based on a condition met inside the loop.
      </li>

    <h2 style="color: #0056b3; margin-bottom: 10px;">📜 Chapter 6: Working with Lists</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-bottom: 15px;">Explore lists, a versatile and fundamental data structure in Python used to store ordered collections of items, which can be of different types.</p>
    <h3 style="color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;">Key Topics / Exam Content:</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px; color: #444;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">What is a list?</strong>: A list is a built-in data structure in Python that represents an ordered sequence of items. Lists are *mutable*, meaning their contents can be changed after creation (items can be added, removed, or modified). Items in a list can be of different data types.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Creating lists \`[]\`</strong>: Lists are created using square brackets \`[]\`, with items separated by commas. Example: \`my_list = [10, "hello", 3.14, True]\`. An empty list is created with \`empty_list = []\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Accessing list items using index (starting from 0)</strong>: Individual items in a list are accessed using their index (position) within square brackets. Indexing starts at \`0\` for the first item. Example: \`my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']\`; \`my_list[0]\` is \`'a'\`, \`my_list[1]\` is \`'b'\`. Negative indexing starts from the end: \`my_list[-1]\` is the last item (\`'c'\`), \`my_list[-2]\` is the second-to-last (\`'b'\`). Accessing an index outside the valid range causes an \`IndexError\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Getting the length of a list: \`len()\`</strong>: The built-in \`len()\` function returns the number of items currently in the list. Example: \`my_list = [1, 2, 3]\`; \`len(my_list)\` returns \`3\`. \`len([])\` returns \`0\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Adding items to the end of a list: \`append()\`</strong>: The \`append()\` method is used to add a *single* item to the very end of a list. It modifies the list in-place (doesn't return a new list). Example: \`my_list = [1, 2]; my_list.append(3)\` changes \`my_list\` to \`[1, 2, 3]\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Checking if an item exists in a list (\`in\` keyword)</strong>: The \`in\` operator checks if a specific value exists as an item within the list. It returns \`True\` if the item is found, \`False\` otherwise. Example: \`my_list = ['apple', 'banana']; 'apple' in my_list\` returns \`True\`; \`'orange' in my_list\` returns \`False\`.

    <h2 style="color: #0056b3; margin-bottom: 10px;">⚙️ Chapter 7: Creating Reusable Code (Functions)</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-bottom: 15px;">Learn how to define and call your own functions to organize code into logical blocks, make it reusable, and improve the readability of your programs.</p>
    <h3 style="color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;">Key Topics / Exam Content:</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px; color: #444;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Why use functions?</strong>: Functions help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. They promote code reuse (write once, use multiple times), improve organization and readability, make code easier to test and debug, and facilitate collaboration. Follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Defining a function using \`def\`</strong>: Functions are defined using the \`def\` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses \`()\`, and a colon \`:\`. The code block that forms the function's body must be indented. Syntax: \`def function_name(parameters): \\n    # indented function body\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Calling a function</strong>: To execute the code inside a function, you "call" it by using its name followed by parentheses \`()\`, providing any required arguments inside the parentheses. Example: If defined \`def greet():\`, call it with \`greet()\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Function parameters (inputs)</strong>: Parameters are variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the input values the function expects to receive when called. Example: \`def greet(name):\` defines a function with one parameter named \`name\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Function arguments (values passed in)</strong>: Arguments are the actual values that are passed into the function when it is called. These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters defined in the function signature. Example: \`greet("Alice")\` calls the \`greet\` function, passing the string \`"Alice"\` as the argument for the \`name\` parameter.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">The \`return\` statement (getting output from a function)</strong>: The \`return\` statement is used inside a function to send a value back to the part of the program that called the function. When \`return\` is executed, the function immediately stops running. A function can return any type of value (number, string, list, boolean, etc.). If \`return\` is omitted or used without a value, the function implicitly returns \`None\`. Example: \`def add(x, y): return x + y\`. Calling \`result = add(3, 5)\` would store \`8\` in the \`result\` variable.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Simple functions with and without parameters/return values</strong>: Understand the four basic types:
          <ul>
              <li>No parameters, no return: \`def say_hello(): print("Hello")\`</li>
              <li>With parameters, no return: \`def greet_person(name): print(f"Hello, {name}!")\`</li>
              <li>No parameters, with return: \`def get_pi(): return 3.14159\`</li>
              <li>With parameters, with return: \`def multiply(a, b): return a * b\`</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: #0056b3; margin-bottom: 10px;">⌨️ Chapter 8: Basic Input and Output</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-bottom: 15px;">Learn how to make your programs interactive by getting input from the user via the keyboard and displaying information back to the user on the screen.</p>
    <h3 style="color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;">Key Topics / Exam Content:</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px; color: #444;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Getting user input using \`input()\`</strong>: The built-in \`input()\` function prompts the user for input and reads a line of text from the keyboard. It pauses program execution until the user types something and presses Enter. Optionally, you can provide a string argument to \`input()\` which will be displayed as a prompt message. Example: \`name = input("Enter your name: ")\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Understanding that \`input()\` returns a string</strong>: This is a crucial point. Regardless of what the user types (numbers, letters, symbols), the \`input()\` function *always* returns the result as a string (\`str\`).
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Converting input using \`int()\` or \`float()\` for calculations</strong>: If you need to perform mathematical operations on user input that represents a number, you must first convert the string returned by \`input()\` into a numerical type (\`int\` for whole numbers, \`float\` for numbers with decimals). Use the \`int()\` or \`float()\` functions for this conversion. Example: \`age_str = input("Enter your age: "); age_num = int(age_str)\`. Be aware this can cause a \`ValueError\` if the user types non-numeric input.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Printing variables and text together</strong>: The \`print()\` function can display multiple items. You can pass variables and string literals separated by commas; \`print()\` will automatically add spaces between them. Example: \`name = "Bob"; age = 25; print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)\` outputs \`Name: Bob Age: 25\`. Alternatively, use string concatenation (\`+\`), but remember to convert non-strings to strings using \`str()\` first: \`print("Name: " + name + " Age: " + str(age))\`.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="color: #000;">Basic formatted output using f-strings (e.g., \`f'Hello, {name}!'\`)</strong>: F-strings (formatted string literals) provide a concise and readable way to embed expressions (like variable values) directly within string literals. Prefix the string literal with \`f\` or \`F\`. Place variables or expressions inside curly braces \`{}\` within the string. Example: \`name = "Charlie"; age = 30; print(f"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")\` outputs \`Hello, my name is Charlie and I am 30 years old.\`. This is generally the preferred method for string formatting in modern Python.

            text: `Here's my thought process for generating the software design flashcards in JSON format:
  
  1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants a set of flashcards about software design. The format must be JSON, specifically an array of objects, where each object has a \`front\` key (question/keyword/concept) and a \`back\` key (answer/definition). The maximum number of flashcards is 15.
  
  2.  **Identify Key Software Design Concepts:** I need to brainstorm core topics within software design that are suitable for flashcard format (concise question/answer). My internal knowledge base includes:
      *   **Core Principles:** SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI.
      *   **Design Patterns (Categories/Examples):** Creational (Singleton, Factory), Structural (Adapter, Decorator), Behavioral (Observer, Strategy).
      *   **Architectural Patterns:** MVC, MVVM, Microservices, Monolithic.
      *   **Key Concepts:** Coupling, Cohesion, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Separation of Concerns.
      *   **Methodologies/Approaches:** Agile (though more process, design is influenced), Domain-Driven Design (DDD).
      *   **Diagramming/Modeling:** UML (though maybe too broad for one card).
      *   **Quality Attributes:** Maintainability, Scalability, Testability, Performance.
  
  3.  **Select Concepts for Flashcards (Aiming for Variety and Importance):** I'll pick a mix from the brainstormed list, focusing on fundamental and widely recognized concepts. I need to keep the 15-card limit in mind.
  
      *   SOLID (Maybe break down one or two principles?) -> Let's do the 'S' (Single Responsibility Principle).
      *   DRY -> Good concise principle.
      *   KISS -> Another good concise principle.
      *   YAGNI -> Yet another good concise principle.
      *   Coupling -> Fundamental concept.
      *   Cohesion -> Counterpart to Coupling, also fundamental.
      *   Abstraction -> Core OO/design concept.
      *   Encapsulation -> Core OO/design concept.
      *   Design Pattern (General) -> What is it?
      *   Singleton Pattern -> Common Creational example.
      *   Strategy Pattern -> Common Behavioral example.
      *   Adapter Pattern -> Common Structural example.
      *   MVC -> Common Architectural Pattern.
      *   Microservices -> Modern Architectural Pattern.
      *   Refactoring -> Important design *activity*.
  
      This gives me 15 concepts. Perfect.
  
  4.  **Formulate \`front\` and \`back\` for each concept:** Now, I'll turn each selected concept into a question/keyword/concept for the \`front\` and a concise definition/explanation for the \`back\`.
  
      *   **SRP:**
          *   \`front\`: "What is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)?"

          *   \`front\`: "What is Coupling in software design?"
          *   \`back\`: "The degree of interdependence between software modules. Low coupling is generally preferred."
      *   **Cohesion:**
          *   \`front\`: "What is Cohesion in software design?"
          *   \`back\`: "The degree to which the elements inside a single module belong together. High cohesion is generally preferred."
      *   **Abstraction:**

          *   \`back\`: "A general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design."
      *   **Singleton Pattern:**
          *   \`front\`: "What is the Singleton Pattern?"
          *   \`back\`: "A creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it."
      *   **Strategy Pattern:**
          *   \`front\`: "What is the Strategy Pattern?"
          *   \`back\`: "A behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime by defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable."

          *   \`back\`: "The process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior, aimed at improving non-functional attributes."
  
  5.  **Format as JSON:** Now, assemble these \`front\`/\`back\` pairs into the required JSON structure: an array \`[...]\` where each element is an object \`{ "front": "...", "back": "..." }\`.
  
      \`\`\`json
      [
        {
          "front": "What is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)?",
          "back": "A class or module should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility."

      *   Is it valid JSON? Yes.
      *   Does it follow the \`{"front": "", "back": ""}\` structure for each item? Yes.
      *   Is it an array of these objects? Yes.
      *   Are there 15 or fewer items? Yes, exactly 15.

I've been working on structuring the quiz for "What is Software Design?" and the "Importance of Good Software Design." The JSON structure is taking shape, with the \`quizTitle\` and the initial list of \`questions\` defined. I'm focusing on crafting clear and concise questions, along with plausible options to test understanding. I'm also ensuring the JSON is valid and ready for implementation.


**Expanding the Question Pool**

I'm now populating the JSON with specific questions, covering the core concepts. For "What is Software Design?", I'm crafting questions about its definition, levels (high-level vs. low-level), and key activities. When it comes to "Importance of Good Software Design," I'm focused on maintainability, scalability, and reusability, forming these concepts into quiz-ready questions. The JSON structure is validated and ready for further population.


**Constructing Quiz Questions**
